## James Baker

Over the last twenty years I have worked as an analyst for a software firm delivering derivatives trading system's to investment banks, as a big 4 management consultant advising on capital markets systems transformations, as an IT project manager implementing large scale IT change programmes for global investment banks and currently as an agile project manager delivering mobile and web apps to large corporates. I completed Makers Academy at the end of 2016 and have been coding in my spare time ever since, learning both JavaScript and Python, whilst working for a small technical consultancy.  I have now decided that the time is right for me to pursue my long term ambition of becoming a software developer.  My interest in software development started whilst working as an analyst for a software firm and I am excited that I have now, some 15 years later, taken the plunge with Makers Academy to become a professional software developer.

I'm looking for Full Stack junior developer roles where I can start to use my skills gained at Maker's Academy whilst also being encouraged to develop and learn new skills and contribute to the production of great software.

## Skills

#### Analysis

Having worked as a business analyst within a software firm, I have developed excellent technical analytical skills, which have enabled me to break down features and requirements into manageable user stories to be used to drive the development of projects.  These skills have been invaluable both in my career to date as well as during my time with Makers Academy and I believe, will help me to become a highly effective software developer.

I am an excellent problem solver with an analytical and logical approach to problems.  This enables me to come up with sensible hypotheses that allow me to work through potential solutions.  I have been challenged at Maker's Academy on numerous occasions with development problems and in the main have been able to solve them by using these skills.

#### Adaptability

I have had a varied and successful career to date, working in many different capacities where I have been required to pick up new concepts quickly. In some instances I have had to undertake numerous tasks as part of my role, from detailed business analysis right through to Programme Management and senior stakeholder engagement.  This adaptability has been invaluable whilst learning to become a developer and I believe will continue to help me  effectively put into practice new concepts and technologies in relatively short timeframes.
