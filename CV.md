## James Baker

Over the last twenty years I have worked as an analyst for a software firm delivering derivatives trading system's to investment banks, as a big 4 management consultant advising on capital markets systems transformations and more recently as an IT Project Management implementing large scale IT change programmes for top global investment banks. This year I felt it was time for a career change and to pursue my long term ambition of becoming a software developer.

I'm looking for Full Stack junior developer roles where I can start to use my skills gained whilst at Maker's Academy whilst also being encouraged to develop and learn new skills and contribute to the production of great software.

## Skills

#### Analysis

Having worked as a business analyst within a software firm, developing systems to support financial derivatives trading, I have developed excellent analytical skills. Within a development environment this has enabled me to break down requirements into manageable user stories in order to drive development of projects I have worked on at Maker's Academy.

I am an excellent problem solver and my skills as an analyst allow me to think clearly when addressing problems and come up with sensible hypotheses to help work out solutions.  I have been challenged at Maker's Academy on numerous occasions with development problems and in the main have solved these using my analytical skills.

#### Adaptability

I have had a varied and successful career to date, working in many different capacities where I have been required to pick up new concepts quickly. In some instances I have had to undertake numerous tasks as part of my role from detailed business analysis right through to Programme Management and senior stakeholder engagement.  This adaptability has been invaluable whilst learning to become a developer and I believe will continue to help me grasp new concepts and technologies.
